This file for that I didnt know or woth to mention

(;)             Semicolon is optional but its better to use it because some time u need it 

(let)           used to declare a variable
                (,) we can use to declare more then one variable
                like let username = "wessam" , age = 21

(const)         we dont need (let) to declare a const value
                the way to name const LIKE_THIS so other know that its a const value

(typeof)        to check for variable type
                (Null) to remove value
                (undefined) no value have been sit yet
                (bigint) for larg integer 

(++x)           x=1 console.log(++x) add one then print //print 1
(x++)           x=1 console.log(x++) print then add one //print 2     

(===)           to Compare type and value
(==)            to Compare value

(condition ?    value if true : value if false;) Ternary Operator

(promot)        to ask for a value 

if(number % 2)  this will happen if The remainder is != 0

(do{} while)    happen at least one time even if the condition didnt fulfilled
(while())       happen only if the condition fulfilled

(break)         live the loop
(continue)      go to the start of the loop

(function)      dont need to declare variable type
                (declare) function can be used anywhere 
                function oddNumbers()
                (Expression) function can be used after only
                let end = function()
(arrow function)            : let func = (argl, arg2, ...argN) => expression
                if one arg : let func = arg => expression
                if no  arg : let func = () => expression
(argument)      contain all the arg that got passed to the function
(rest)          contain the rest of the argument but have the ability have an extra arg before it           

(setTimeout)    used for getting function after time 
                setTimeout(functionRef((with out())), delay, param1, param2, /* …, */ paramN)
(clearTimeOut)  to stop setTimeOut if its a variable like let setTimeOut               
(setInterval)   used to get the same function every delay between calls  
                setInterval(func, delay, arg1, arg2, /* …, */ argN)
(clearInterval) to stop setInterval if its a variable like let setInterval 

(Arrays)        to declare an Array look like
                let names = ["spider" , "wessam" ,"bat"];
                and we can print it like this 
                console.log(names)
(for...in)      for index : for (let index in boys) console.log(index);
(for...of)      for items : for (let members of boys) console.log(members)
adding to the array
(arrayname[4])  used if we how long the array is
                we can use this way if we dont how long is it arrayname[arrayname.length]
(.push)         add the the end of the array
(.unshift)      use to add to the array 
(.splice)       to add to the middel of the array (method) Array<string>.splice(start: number, deleteCount?: number | undefined): string[] (+1 overload
                remover form the middle .splice(startin form , how many items to remove)
(.shift)        remove first item
(.pop)          remove last item
(.slice)        to get new array .slice(from,to) or .slice(from) take all the items form the poitnt untill the end or .slice to get a copy
(.concat)       to add another array
                console.log(NicNames.concat(PartNicNames))//print both array
                console.log(NicNames); //print one array
(.indexOf)      for getting first index of a value -1 mean dosnt have the item
(.lastindexOf)  for getting Last index of a value -1 mean dosnt have the item
(.findindexOf)  To get the index of the first item that fulfilled the condition
(.find)         To get the first item that fulfilled the condition
(.filter)       To get all the items that fulfilled the condition

(Objects)       to make an Object let ObjectName = {} //leteral way
(Constructor)   function Person(name,age,gender) {this.name = name; this.age=age ; this.gender = gender;}
access a value inside an Object
                (ObjectName.valueName)  To access a value inside an Object 
                or we can Identify a variable and get access to the value
                const TheName = 'name';
                Person[TheName]
chaing a value inside an Object
                we can chaing a value like this 
                Person.name = 'bat';
                to add new feature ObjectName.fuatureName
                Person.spiders= 'sup man';
for deleting 
                delete Person.spiders;
(for...in)      used for fuatureNames in Object ex for (item in ObjectName) 
                item give us fuatureName
                ObjectName[item] give us fuature value
                we can get the fuature and the value with out function
                if(typeof ObjectName[item] 'function') continue; or we can use this
                const items= Object.items(ObjectName);
                and for getting one fuature we use 
                if( 'fuatureName' in ObjectName)
(Abstract)      if we didnt do this. in function and we used let for variable insted we make Abstract ver and can only be used only in the function

Getters and Setters
                Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)
                Parameter: This method accepts three parameters as mentioned above and described below:
                Obj: This parameter holds the Object on which the user is going to define the property.
                Prop: This parameter holds the name of a property that is going to be defined or modified.
                Descriptor: This parameter holds the descriptor for the property being defined or modified.
                Return Value: This method returns the object which is passed as the argument to the function.
(get)           get : function() {return id;} to return Abstract method 
(set)           set: function(value) {if (!value) throw new Error('Wrong Id') ;id = value;}
                used for chaing Abstract method
(better way to use)
                we can use Getters and setters in another way with out Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)
                class someone{
(_Name)         used for naming privite and protected variable 
                constructor(name,age){
                    this._name = name;
                    this._age = age;
                }
                get age() {return this._age;}
                set name(age) {
                    if (age <1 ) throw new Error('invaled age!');
                    this._age = age;
                }
                }
(protected)     if we dont have setters
(privite)       if we dont have Getters and Setters

(prototype)
                we use prototype to save space in program if the 
                prototype is Primitive type then it save the value for every son alone
                but if it is Reference the value is same for evey son
                const son1 = new son;
                const son2 = new son;
                son.prototype.hello = function(){console.log('hello')}
                
(Reference and Primitive Types)
                Primitive Types (String - Number - Boolean - Null )
                Reference Types (Object - Function - Array)
                Primitive type gets saved by the value, meanwhile they Reference type get saved by the location in the memory
                let OldValue = 1;
                let NewValue = OldValue;
                OldValue = 2;
                console.log(OldValue ,'    ',NewValue);
                //print 2 '    ' 1;

                let oldObject = { numBer : 'one'};
                let newObject = oldObject ;
                oldObject.numBer = 'two';
                now both of them equal newObject {numBer: 'two'} oldObject {numBer: 'two'}

(classes)       just a better function 
                baisc class
                class Person {
                constructor(name){
                this.name = name;}
                hello(){
                console.log( 'Hello World!'); } 
                }
(static)        used to make a variable for calss and can by used by the class      
                if we had class contain static in it like this 
                    static password(){
                    console.log('123456789');
                }
                to get to the variable like this 
                ClassName.StaticMethodName();

(strict mod)    we use it to get the errors that dosnt stop the program and for using 'use strict' in the start of the code
($varName)      for printing a var inside a String NEED TO HAVE `FOR THE TEXT`

(Ingertance)    Used four classes that we need to use more than once. They have the same original value, but they branch after it
                to use class classSonName extends classFatherName {}
(super)         used to get the the variable form the father       super(name,age);

Overriding Method
                1.The existence of an inheritance relationship extends.
                2.The method must have the same name as the father class.
                3.The type of the return value must be the same as the type of the return value of the parent class method.
                just write the name of the method for overloading in the son class
instanceof
                The instanceof keyword checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface
                The instanceof keyword compares the instance with type
                The return value is either true or false
