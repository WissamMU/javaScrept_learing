This file for that I didnt know or woth to mention

(;) Semicolon is optional but its better to use it because some time u need it 

(let) used to declare a variable
      (,) we can use to declare more then one variable
      like let username = "wessam" , age = 21

(const) we dont need (let) to declare a const value
        the way to name const LIKE_THIS so other know that its a const value

(typeof) to check for variable type
         (Null) to remove value
         (undefined) no value have been sit yet
         (bigint) for larg integer 

(Arrays) to declare an Array look like
        let names = ["spider" , "wessam" ,"bat"];
        and we can print it like this 
        console.log(names)

(++x) x=1 console.log(++x) add one then print //print 1
(x++) x=1 console.log(x++) print then add one //print 2     

(===) to Compare type and value
(==)  to Compare value

(condition ? value if true : value if false;) Ternary Operator
