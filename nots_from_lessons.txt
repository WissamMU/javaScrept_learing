This file for that I didnt know or woth to mention

(;)             Semicolon is optional but its better to use it because some time u need it 

(let)           used to declare a variable
                (,) we can use to declare more then one variable
                like let username = "wessam" , age = 21

(const)         we dont need (let) to declare a const value
                the way to name const LIKE_THIS so other know that its a const value

(typeof)        to check for variable type
                (Null) to remove value
                (undefined) no value have been sit yet
                (bigint) for larg integer 

(++x)           x=1 console.log(++x) add one then print //print 1
(x++)           x=1 console.log(x++) print then add one //print 2     

(===)           to Compare type and value
(==)            to Compare value

(condition ?    value if true : value if false;) Ternary Operator

(promot)        to ask for a value 

if(number % 2)  this will happen if The remainder is != 0

(do{} while)    happen at least one time even if the condition didnt fulfilled
(while())       happen only if the condition fulfilled

(break)         live the loop
(continue)      go to the start of the loop

(function)      dont need to declare variable type
                (declare) function can be used anywhere 
                function oddNumbers()
                (Expression) function can be used after only
                let end = function()
(arrow function)            : let func = (argl, arg2, ...argN) => expression
                if one arg : let func = arg => expression
                if no  arg : let func = () => expression
(argument)      contain all the arg that got passed to the function
(rest)          contain the rest of the argument but have the ability have an extra arg before it           

(setTimeout)    used for getting function after time 
                setTimeout(functionRef((with out())), delay, param1, param2, /* …, */ paramN)
(clearTimeOut)  to stop setTimeOut if its a variable like let setTimeOut               
(setInterval)   used to get the same function every delay between calls  
                setInterval(func, delay, arg1, arg2, /* …, */ argN)
(clearInterval) to stop setInterval if its a variable like let setInterval 

(Arrays)        to declare an Array look like
                let names = ["spider" , "wessam" ,"bat"];
                and we can print it like this 
                console.log(names)
(in)            for index : for (let index in boys) console.log(index);
(of)            for items : for (let members of boys) console.log(members)
adding to the array
(arrayname[4])  used if we how long the array is
                we can use this way if we dont how long is it arrayname[arrayname.length]
(.push)         add the the end of the array
(.unshift)      use to add to the array 
(.splice)       to add to the middel of the array (method) Array<string>.splice(start: number, deleteCount?: number | undefined): string[] (+1 overload
                remover form the middle .splice(startin form , how many items to remove)
(.shift)        remove first item
(.pop)          remove last item
(.slice)        to get new array .slice(from,to) or .slice(from) take all the items form the poitnt untill the end or .slice to get a copy
(.concat)       to add another array
                console.log(NicNames.concat(PartNicNames))//print both array
                console.log(NicNames); //print one array
(.indexOf)      for getting first index of a value -1 mean dosnt have the item
(.lastindexOf)  for getting Last index of a value -1 mean dosnt have the item
(.findindexOf)  To get the index of the first item that fulfilled the condition
(.find)         To get the first item that fulfilled the condition
(.filter)       To get all the items that fulfilled the condition

(Objects)       to make an Object let ObjectName = {} //leteral way
(Constructor)   function Person(name,age,gender) {this.name = name; this.age=age ; this.gender = gender;}
