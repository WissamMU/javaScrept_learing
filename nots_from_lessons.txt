This file for that I didnt know or woth to mention

(;) Semicolon is optional but its better to use it because some time u need it 

(let) used to declare a variable
      (,) we can use to declare more then one variable
      like let username = "wessam" , age = 21

(const) we dont need (let) to declare a const value
        the way to name const LIKE_THIS so other know that its a const value

(typeof) to check for variable type
         (Null) to remove value
         (undefined) no value have been sit yet
         (bigint) for larg integer
